# OpenAI Codex 0.156.1

RepoPrompt CE packages the complete official OpenAI Codex standalone package
for the selected macOS architecture. Codex is licensed under Apache-2.0. The
package also includes the upstream Zsh 5.9 executable and the Codex native voice
runtime under `codex-resources/`. The voice runtime dynamically links GStreamer,
GLib, Opus, PCRE2/SLJIT, libffi, proxy-libintl, and zlib.

`LICENSE` and `NOTICE` are exact copies from the pinned Codex tag, and
`ZSH-LICENCE` is an exact copy of the Zsh 5.9 `LICENCE` file. The `VOICE-*`
files are exact copies of the notice, source manifest, and licence files shipped
inside the official 0.156.1 macOS package. The application preserves the full
standalone package layout and pins every upstream-signed Mach-O.

For the 0.156.1 patch rotation, upstream `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` and the packaged
voice notice, source manifest, and licences remain byte-identical to 0.156.0.
The native voice runtime and its legal inventory remain included deliberately;
`SHA256SUMS` covers this complete flat inventory.
