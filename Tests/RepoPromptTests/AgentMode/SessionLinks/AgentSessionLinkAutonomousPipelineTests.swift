/// Every other oversight suite proves one seam against synthetic inputs: the readiness reducer
/// against a hand-built snapshot, the coordinator against a hand-published lane snapshot, the live
/// transaction against a hand-built request. Each of those was individually satisfied by the retired
/// caller-origin fence too — the fence only became visible when the *second* hop asked for a turn.
/// So this suite composes the real pieces instead: one real bridge over a real authority, three real
/// `AgentModeViewModel` sessions in three windows, real target readiness, real passive reduction,
/// real Auto-wake admission, and real prompt claiming. Only the provider transport is stubbed.
///
/// What it pins is the product ruling itself: the user's two direct grants are the whole delegation,
/// so `completion → wake → send → completion → wake → send → completion → wake` runs to the end
/// without a human utterance, while each hop still needs its own independently created grant and
/// nothing is inherited by being overseen.
