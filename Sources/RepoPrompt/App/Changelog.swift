        ### Improvements
        - Codex /goal now works alongside selected app workflows, and typed goal objectives appear immediately as user bubbles in Agent Mode
        - Staged /goal drafts are now visible in the Agent Mode status row
        - ask_user prompts no longer expire while you're typing your answer
        - Faster file tree updates during heavy filesystem activity
        - Updated Z.ai GLM defaults to GLM-5.2 with 1M-context Claude Code routing support

        ### Fixes
        - MCP `read_file` now returns exact paths reusable by `apply_edits`, and rejects fuzzy basename or suffix matches
        - Fixed file tree churn when folders changed on disk
        - Fixed Oracle preview transcripts showing in the wrong chat
        - Fixed the prompt export copy button disappearing in long Agent Mode sessions
        - Fixed Codex goal tracking when using /goal control actions
        - Deep Plan now waits for you instead of silently defaulting when an involvement checkpoint times out

        ### Notes
        - The agent_run MCP/CLI surface no longer accepts the native_workflow parameter — Codex /goal and /computer-use remain available as in-app slash commands

        ## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-02

        ### New Features
        - MCP-controlled agents and sub-agents — start and steer Agent Mode sessions from external MCP clients or the CLI, with cross-family sub-agent support (Claude can steer Codex, Codex can steer Claude)
        - Agent role defaults — configure default models per agent role (explore, engineer, pair, design) with per-role override controls

        ### Improvements
        - Faster window restore — consolidated session data loading for less main-thread blocking
        - Cleaner MCP API — dedicated manage_selection and prompt tools replace context_state; chat tools renamed to oracle for consistency
        - New context_bind tool — easier workspace binding via working directories
        - Cmd+W now stashes compose tabs instead of closing them

        ### Fixes
        - Improved app stability — fixed crashes on deeply nested directory trees
        - Fixed memory retention issues for large repositories
        - Fixed file_search hanging on regex patterns with .* or .+ quantifiers

            - Oracle review status stays scoped to the originating Agent Mode thread instead of leaking into other tabs
            - Hardened Cursor / OpenCode lifecycle — addresses the crash reported in 2.1.20
            - Stronger MCP routing isolation — restricted agents are no longer asked to call hidden routing tools, and stale clients can no longer claim run policies
            - Safer steering — Claude interrupts now wait for in-flight child agent waits to drain
            - Cleaner sidebar status plate — MCP-controlled rows align consistently with regular rows; running spinner no longer shows a disc behind the arc

            ## [2.1.20] - 2026-04-24

            ### Improvements
            - Agent Mode sidebar shows persistent attention badges when background tabs complete, fail, or start waiting — so status changes in collapsed or off-screen sessions aren't missed
            - Faster session switching in Agent Mode — eliminated duplicate transcript and runtime refreshes when flipping between running sessions
            - Agent logs (`get_log`) now preserve assistant narration in correct chronological order around tool calls
            - Tightened agent sidebar row density, with collapsed threads propagating unseen status counts

            ### Improvements
            - Expanded explore-agent dispatch guidance so agents make better judgment calls about when to spawn a sub-agent versus reading files inline
            - Progress updates now stream across all agent providers (previously Codex-only), so you see interleaved status messages regardless of model

            - Fixed a deadlock that could hang the app when running multiple parallel agents (e.g. concurrent orchestration or investigation workflows). Force Quit was sometimes required to recover.
            - Agent handoff/fork from historical messages now uses the authoritative transcript, so forks no longer incorrectly include the latest conversation state

            - Compose tab capacity policy — background agent tabs can exceed the normal soft tab limit with auto-stashing that protects active or pinned agent sessions from eviction

            - Explore agents can now be used proactively without explicit invocation (engineer, pair, and design still require opt-in)

            ### Improvements

            - Brand new agentic context builder that leverages either Claude Code or Codex, using your existing installation and subscription, to automate connecting Repo Prompt's MCP tools to a headless agent to act as a context scout, to select the right files, codemaps, and file slices, as well as write an optimized prompt, all fitting within a prescribed token budget
            - You can now granularly control files and codemaps, to tune in your prompt to the right size, which is especially useful for GPT-5 Pro's limited 60k token window

            - **Git Diffs in Prompts:** Prompts now support including Git diffs from either all files or your exact file selection—perfect for focused reviews or sharing the context of your changes.
            - **Customizable Prompt Sections:** The prompt editor now lets you reorder, enable, or disable the new Git Diff section right alongside file trees and code maps. Existing prompt setups are seamlessly upgraded to add this flexibility.
            - **Reliable Diff Copying:** Copying Git diffs (selected or all files) is now instant and robust—even for complex or large changes.
            - **Transparent Token Breakdown:** Prompt builder now reports estimated token usage per section (including Git, tree, and maps) so you can fine-tune content and stay within model limits.
            - **Workspace Stability:** Saving workspaces and presets is now fully asynchronous, fixing rare issues with settings lost or conflicted between app windows.
            - **UI Polish:** Compact prompt and settings controls for a cleaner interface.

            ### Fixes
            - **Seamless Prompt Migration:** Prompt section order is upgraded automatically—new options like Git appear without disrupting your setup.
