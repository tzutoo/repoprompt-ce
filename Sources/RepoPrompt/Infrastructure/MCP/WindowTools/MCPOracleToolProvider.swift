Each item is `{path,title?}` with a canonical absolute path inside the current loaded roots — a screenshot saved under a workspace root is fine — or the exact path of an image the user attached to this agent session (pasted or dropped into the composer; its path is listed in the user's message). Remote URLs, relative paths, sibling attachments, and arbitrary files outside the loaded roots are rejected before a message is sent, and models on transports without image input reject `images` with an error. Image input is additional to pre-send text estimates and Context Builder text-selection budgets. Originals, not transcript thumbnails, are sent to each Oracle lane; group fan-out multiplies image usage/cost, not any one request's attachment cap. Provider-reported input totals may already include image usage. Session attachment files are normally deleted when the agent turn ends; forward them during that turn. Originals are this-turn-only: continuations do not automatically reattach prior images or send saved thumbnails. `oracle_send` does not accept images; continue image-bearing conversations with `ask_oracle` + `chat_id`. Limits: \(OracleImageAttachmentLimits.production.maxCount) images, \(OracleImageAttachmentLimits.production.maxBytesPerImage / 1_048_576) MiB each, \(OracleImageAttachmentLimits.production.maxTotalBytes / 1_048_576) MiB total, measured as raw attachment-file bytes before provider encoding. The selected provider or model may impose additional restrictions; accepted attachments do not guarantee full-request or model-context fit."
