// before anything mutated, the one-shot outcome sink the ordinary submission paths resolve, and
// the context those paths receive in place of composer state.
//
// A steer reuses the target's own submission routing (`submitPreparedUserTurn`) so a running Codex,
// Claude, or ACP turn is steered exactly the way a local composer message steers it. What it never
// reuses is composer state: no draft, attachment, tagged file, workflow, or interview mode is read,
// cleared, or restored, and a withdrawn steer is never put back into the target user's composer,
// where an overseer's words would read as the user's own draft.

/// Provider route one managed steer takes, classified before the attributed row exists.
///
/// Deliberately short. An idle target is not a route: it goes through the durable send transaction.

/// back to the target user's composer on their recovery paths.
