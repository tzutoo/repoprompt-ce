    /// Builds one bounded page from the canonical row sequence.
    ///
    /// Paging always moves forward: a resumed cursor continues strictly *after* its anchor, even when
    /// the source revision advanced through appends. `direction` decides only where a fresh page
    /// starts — `tail` gives the recent tail (so the next cursor tracks new activity), `start` walks
    /// history from the beginning.
    ///
    /// This walk is bounded by the page. Rows are sanitized lazily while it moves outward from the
    /// page's own starting row in its fill direction — backwards from the newest row for a fresh
    /// `tail`, forwards from just after the anchor otherwise — and it stops at the first row that
    /// does not fit the item/byte budget, or at `pageSourceRowScanLimit` source rows when omitted
    /// rows are producing no content to budget against. Only the one refused row is sanitized beyond
    /// the page, and it is what makes `has_more` exact. Resuming costs `O(log n)` to locate the
    /// anchor rather than a linear scan. Redaction is the expensive part of a read, so keeping it
    /// proportional to the page is what stops one authorized `read` from paying for a whole
    /// transcript.
    ///
    /// **Emission and consumption are separate, at the live edge only.** Every row this walk reaches
    /// is *emitted* under the item/byte budgets. The **newest** row is additionally not *consumed* —
    /// it does not carry `nextAnchor` past itself — while its observer-visible representation is
    /// still mutable (`isFinalizedForOversight(row:)`). Consuming it would place it at or before the
    /// cursor, and the finished form it later takes under the same row ID would never be returned.
    /// Left unconsumed, the reader sees the live content now and receives it again, finished, on its
    /// next read: one repeated row instead of lost content, and `item_id` is stable so the reader
    /// updates in place rather than double-counting.
    ///
    /// **Why only the newest row.** Parking on any mutable row anywhere would be a worse bug than the
    /// one it fixes. "Not final" does not imply "will become final": a crash mid-tool-call persists a
    /// `.toolCall` row that cold restore never promotes, so a cursor that parked on it would sit
    /// there forever and every later row — the entire rest of the transcript — would be silently
    /// unreachable. Restricting the park to the newest row makes that impossible by construction:
    /// nothing exists after the newest row, so parking withholds nothing, and the next appended row
    /// ends the park with no timeout, constant, or run-state input. Head-of-line blocking cannot
    /// occur — a long-running tool call never hides the rows behind it.
    ///
    /// The accepted residual is the mirror image: a mutable row that is *not* newest is consumed, so
    /// a streaming assistant row interrupted by a user interjection, or a pending tool call that
    /// completes after a sibling, keeps whatever the observer last saw (for a tool row, `called`).
    /// The staleness is bounded *per row* — only the form already delivered goes stale, never a row
    /// the observer has not seen — and each page can strand at most the mutable rows it consumed.
    /// It is **not** globally single-row: `isFinalizedForOversight(row:)` classifies every pending
    /// `.toolCall` as mutable while only the newest is parked, so a target running tools in parallel
    /// can have several earlier `.toolCall` rows consumed as `called` and promoted afterwards, and
    /// each advance of the live edge can strand one more. It is still deliberately preferred over an
    /// unbounded park: stale text is recoverable context — a fresh `start` read re-delivers every row
    /// in its current form — while an unreachable transcript tail is not.
    ///
    /// **A fresh tail keeps a baseline even when the parked row is all that fits.** The park sets no
    /// consumed anchor, so a fresh `tail` whose budget admits only the live-edge row would otherwise
    /// fall through to `.beforeStart` — which means "resume forward from row zero" — and walk a tail
    /// observer into history it never asked for, contradicting the tail contract and re-delivering
    /// far more than one row. Such a page instead anchors at the row immediately *before* the parked
    /// one, emitted or not. That is legitimate only for a fresh tail, which deliberately excludes
    /// older history and never promised its predecessor: `has_more` already says nothing newer is
    /// pending, and the observer reaches older rows through a `start` cursor. A start or resumed
    /// forward page must never do this — there a refused row is promised content and has to stay
    /// unconsumed.
    ///
    /// The **caller** materializes and sorts the whole canonical projection before this runs, so an
    /// authorized read is still `O(transcript)` end-to-end — that part now happens off the
