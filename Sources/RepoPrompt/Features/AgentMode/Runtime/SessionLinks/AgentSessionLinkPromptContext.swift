// epoch and eligibility that decide whether a supplement may ride on a dispatch, the immutable
// outbound claim with its passive-batch receipt (exact status rows and attention occurrence
// identities), and the store that reserves, accepts, or abandons those claims. It authors no prompt
// text. Every string and every byte-budget decision comes from `AgentSessionLinkPrompts.rendered(_:)`,
// which this file calls exactly once per claim; `AgentSessionLinkPromptComposer` only appends the
// finished fragment. Coordinates with `AgentModeViewModel+SessionLinkPrompt` (the window-local seam
// that builds render requests from live state) and `AgentSessionLinkPassiveStatusNotices` (whose
// snapshot is the input and whose receipt application is the output). Invariant: acceptance is
// occurrence-qualified — a receipt removes only what its own rendered batch named, so a stale or
// out-of-order receipt can never clear a successor occurrence.
