// The `delivery: "when_sendable"` queue: one pre-authorized send waiting for its target to become
// sendable, plus the terminal outcomes and queue results the tool reports.
//
// Entries are values held by `AgentSessionLinkRuntimeBridge`, keyed by exact observer and
// generation-qualified link reference, and re-evaluated through
// `AgentSessionLinkDeliveryReadiness` whenever the target's readiness publisher fires. Invariants:
// a queued entry is bound to the grant that authorized it, so unlink or revocation discards it
// rather than delivering it; replacement and cancellation are per-lane and never touch another
// observer's entry; and a queued send never bypasses the same readiness matrix a direct `send`
// must clear.

/// rebind, endpoint drift, either side closing, shutdown, and relaunch all end it rather than
/// migrate it. There is at most one per link generation, and no scheduler, timer, or queue manager
/// owns it — every drain is triggered by an event that already exists.
