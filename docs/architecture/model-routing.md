# Model Routing Architecture

Current as of 2026-09-24.

## Auto effort (independent opt-in)

`Auto effort` is a separate persisted setting under `scalarPreferences.agentMode`, default off. It does not enable Model Router or change its policy. Before an eligible user turn from either the composer or MCP `agent_run`, Jev chooses only the effort for the already-selected exact Codex or Claude model. First MCP starts and settled follow-ups may use it, including an explicitly pinned model whose effort becomes the manual fallback. A first start already routed by Model Router retains that router's model-and-effort decision. Active-turn steering, slash controls, and unsupported models retain their existing effort behavior. A failed or unavailable Jev judgment falls back to the current manual effort.

The Auto effort request contains only a short, locally best-effort-masked excerpt of the current composer or MCP user message, the selected model ID, the effort choices, and the fixed category of a selected built-in workflow. It does not attach workflow templates, files, tool results, or earlier conversation. Custom workflows keep manual effort rather than disclosing user-authored templates or judging an incomplete task. Masking is not a promise of anonymization: sensitive prose can remain. Settings disclose the TypeSafe transfer and privacy policy; enabling through the pill first displays a disclosure confirmation. After the asynchronous judgment, RPCE rejects a choice if the workflow selection changed; the provider send also rechecks the model, manual effort, and setting. The choice is ephemeral and does not update saved model or effort preferences. The selected runtime applies effort before the user turn, not within an autonomous tool loop. A pill beside Router shows a pending judgment and the last Jev choice submitted for the current model, with an up/down change relative to the preceding Jev choice (or initial selected effort). Intervening manual turns are not reflected in the arrow. This is not an acknowledgement that a provider turn completed or reused its prompt cache.

Cache preservation is **not guaranteed** by this feature. The Codex app-server and Claude Code controls used by RPCE are distinct from their providers' direct API mechanisms; actual request-level behavior and savings require separate measurement.

## Status

RepoPrompt CE contains a backend-neutral routing framework, app-global Settings and Agent Mode integration, and a bundled Jev adapter. After a TypeSafe key is verified, the persistent `Router` pill can enable routing across sessions. While enabled, routing applies to each new user-created Agent Mode session and each RepoPrompt-managed subagent start. Existing provider sessions, continuations, and steering retain their established target.

## Authority boundary

The host framework owns:

- durable enablement, backend selection, optional per-scope provider requirements, and custom guidance;
- candidate construction from a router-owned quality/cost frontier and live provider catalogs;
- complete executable target identity: provider, model, reasoning effort, and normalized ACP parameters;
- the privacy-bounded semantic request;
- exact request ownership, cancellation, normalized outcome validation, and eventual selection-and-submit transaction.

A backend adapter owns:

- backend identity and display metadata;
- credential/configuration readiness;
- wire encoding, transport, and strict response decoding;
- its versioned selection policy.

Adapters receive exact task text when it fits the local envelope, or a bounded, best-effort-masked opening and ending excerpt for a longer task, plus optional user-authored routing guidance, routing scope, opaque candidate keys, candidate provider/model/effort descriptions, dated capability and API-list-price evidence, and fixed utility-tier rubrics. They do not receive workspace/repository names, paths, file contents, selections, diffs, transcripts, system prompts, tools, permission state, downstream credentials, or provider session identity. They never invoke downstream providers.

`AgentTaskRouterRegistry` is an internal compile-time composition seam, not a dynamic plug-in ABI. Unknown persisted backend identifiers are preserved but resolve unavailable; the registry never substitutes another backend.

## Durable configuration

`scalarPreferences.modelRouter` is an optional group introduced in schema v9 and extended in schema v10:

```text
enabled
selectedBackendRawValue
candidateRoleRawValues
allowedProviderRawValues
primaryProviderRawValue
subagentProviderRawValue
customInstructions
```

Absence resolves disabled. `enabled` is durable user intent: transient credential readiness and provider availability never rewrite it. An explicit user toggle or a successful explicit stored-secret removal may disable routing; startup validation failures and temporarily empty provider catalogs leave routing enabled but advisory; eligible tasks continue with the current selection or role default. The optional primary and subagent provider fields are hard constraints for their scopes; when unset, every supported connected provider participates. Custom guidance is trimmed, limited to 1,000 characters and 4,096 UTF-8 bytes, and sent to the routing backend with each request as an explicit preference. Known-setting edits preserve unknown nonblank backend, role, and provider raw values for forward/rollback compatibility. Secrets never enter this document.

`candidateRoleRawValues` and `allowedProviderRawValues` are retained only for schema and rollback compatibility with the earlier preset-based implementation. They no longer affect candidate construction. Manual Agent Models settings are authoritative only when Router is off or an already-established session continues.

## Jev adapter

The bundled adapter uses TypeSafe's documented HTTP surface directly; there is no Swift SDK:

- `GET https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/models` validates an account from a supported Jev alias/family entry (`name`); the pinned version need not appear in that alias list;
- `POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone` sends a map containing one `route` choice question and always pins evaluation to `jev-1.13.0`;
- `JevJudgmentBatch` owns the structural contract for that question map. The adapter can construct and validate a batch of independent choice questions, but the shipped routing policy submits exactly one `route` question per decision, so the batch adapter itself does not change the transmitted payload or routing policy version. Submitting more than one question is a future policy change that must advance the policy version;
- Bearer authentication;
- one request, five-second outer deadline, no RepoPrompt-layer retry;
- explicit 401/403, 422, 429, and 529 classification;
- no request/response-body logging.

`JevRoutingResponseInterpreter` strictly validates returned evaluator identity, every submitted question's choice answer, exact opaque-key coverage, finite ranged probabilities, distribution sum, a unique probability argmax matching `choice`, confidence, and nonnegative usage. Each submitted question must be answered exactly once: a missing answer, an answer for a question that was not submitted, and an answer referencing a sibling question's opaque key are all rejected. Opaque keys are scoped to their own question, so batching never weakens the single-question guarantees. The current selection policy accepts that unique validated argmax and records the full probability distribution, confidence, and token usage as evidence. It does not apply a separate confidence threshold.

The Jev key uses the dedicated `JevRouterAPIKey` secure-storage account. It is included in the complete repair inventory but excluded from provider/CLI, Claude-compatible, and frozen identity-migration inventories. The app-global credential service is shared across windows; each Settings window owns only its view model and observes live `APISettingsViewModel.agentAvailability`.

Startup readiness observation is noninteractive. For an explicitly selected, enabled routing backend—or Jev when Auto effort alone is enabled—the runtime reads the stored credential noninteractively and validates it through the Jev model-list endpoint; inactive and disabled backends are not contacted. A transient or definitive readiness failure does not erase the persisted enablement intent. Selecting a backend while both features remain disabled does not validate it—validation is an explicit Settings action.

## Adding a bundled backend

1. Implement `AgentTaskRouterBackend` with a stable lowercase ID.
2. Keep transport, credentials, response validation, and acceptance policy in the backend directory.
3. Register the adapter once in `AgentTaskRouterRuntime`; duplicate IDs are programmer errors.
4. Attach its redacted Settings presentation/actions controller to the registration without putting secrets or backend switches into generic state.
5. Test unknown selection, cancellation, readiness-generation changes, privacy, and normalized outcomes using the generic coordinator.
6. Return `selected` only after validating the response against the submitted opaque candidate set and the backend's versioned policy.

Adding a backend must not require changes to candidate construction, the semantic privacy contract, or provider runtimes.

## Generic host integration

For a new user-created Agent Mode session, the host reads the persistent policy after the final destination and execution location are ready, but immediately before `submitUserTurn`. It rechecks fresh-session eligibility, builds a router-owned frontier of up to twelve distinct executable targets from the live Claude Code and Codex catalogs, applies the optional primary-session provider requirement, and awaits the selected registration through exact coordinator ownership. The maintained frontier currently contributes economy, balanced, strong, and frontier model/effort points for each connected provider when those exact targets are available. For the approved Codex `sol` and `luna` families, semantic version comparison selects the newest provider-advertised family member (for example GPT-6 over GPT-5.6); unknown families are never promoted automatically. Claude Code prefers pinned Opus 5.5 when advertised, falling back to the stable `opus` alias and then older pinned IDs. One remaining target is applied locally without a Jev request. Selected targets are committed with provider, model, reasoning effort, and normalized ACP parameters. Any submission rejection rolls that complete target back without writing manual defaults. Model-stage abstention or failure uses the current selection. Effort-stage failure keeps Jev’s chosen model at provider-default effort. Neither blocks the task; explicit cancellation and stale ownership still block submission. Failed newly-created destinations are discarded and the exact source tab is reactivated.

RepoPrompt-managed `agent_run` and `agent_explore` starts use the same policy with subagent scope and its provider limit. Routing occurs before the provider session starts. An explicit compound `model_id` or explicit `model_parameters` request remains authoritative and bypasses global routing. For Claude compound IDs with an effort suffix, that effort is the MCP session's initial manual baseline without changing global preferences; a later manual effort change replaces it. Role-based and default child starts may be routed. A settings revision/backend fence rejects a result when the global policy changes while Jev is deciding.

The routing envelope has a local 4,000-character / 16-KiB task-text ceiling; it is a RepoPrompt disclosure and latency guard, not Jev's context limit. For a longer task, the host sends Jev a deterministic, best-effort-masked opening and ending excerpt with an omission marker, while the full original task goes only to the implementation provider. Masking can miss sensitive prose, and this exposes bounded excerpts of tasks previously kept from Jev; Settings discloses that transfer. Explicitly pinned MCP starts bypass Router. Do not increase this ceiling merely because Jev accepts more tokens: longer raw prompts can expose private material and distract the routing judgment.

An in-flight route is one ownership record indexed by both its source and final destination tabs. The visible destination exposes the exact cancel action, and either related tab rejects a second submit until that ownership settles. Cancellation removes both indexes before late backend completion can reach submission.

Jev's five-second deadline uses a first-result ownership bridge rather than structured task-group teardown: timeout or cancellation settles the caller immediately, cancels the transport task for cleanup, and filters any late result even if a transport ignores cancellation. Credential validation uses the same boundary, so generation cancellation cannot wait on or publish a late validation response.

When Router is disabled, top-level submission and MCP child-start selection follow their previous paths without creating a routing request. Continuations, steering, Chat/Oracle, Context Builder, and provider-owned nested behavior remain unchanged in both states.

## Jev selection policy

The current policy version binds the pinned `jev-1.13.0` evaluator to the v7 model-then-effort automatic-frontier policy with bounded long-task excerpts over the session-routing contract. Jev receives two to twelve opaque criteria with human-readable provider/model/effort descriptions, dated capability and API-list-price evidence, scope, optional custom guidance, and utility-tier rubrics. The policy infers the complete expected work rather than over-weighting the task's first verb, prioritizes reliable completion, then avoids unnecessary cost and latency among targets with a clear capability margin. It treats retries, avoidable clarification, missed requirements, and incomplete work as costs rather than equating low token price with value. High effort on a weaker base model is explicitly not treated as stronger base-model capability. User guidance is an explicit preference and hard per-scope provider requirements filter candidates before the request. RepoPrompt accepts only a structurally valid response whose declared choice is the unique probability argmax. Authentication failure invalidates readiness for the credential generation that made the request. Transport, rate-limit, overload, timeout, and response-validation failures leave the current selection or role default in control rather than blocking the task.

The evidence snapshot is versioned as `rpce.model-routing-evidence.2026-09-23`. Prices are provider-published API list prices per one million tokens, used only as a common comparison proxy because Claude Code and Codex subscription or credit billing can differ. Published benchmark results are identified as provider-reported and are not treated as perfectly comparable across harnesses. Unknown model identities state that capability and cost are uncertain instead of inheriting a guess from a nearby family.

Refresh this evidence and advance its version when current aliases, frontier targets, prices, or material published evaluations change. Quality evaluation can refine the instructions, rubrics, pinned evaluator, evidence, or acceptance rule in a later version. Such a change must advance the policy version and keep deterministic wire and response-validation fixtures.

## Validation scope

Repository tests cover schema-v9 compatibility and schema-v10 scoped policy preservation, router-owned frontier construction independent of manual role settings, hard provider filtering, one-target local application, registration-owned Settings, readiness generation streams, transport cancellation, exact official Jev shapes, scope/guidance encoding, unique argmax/evaluator checks, authenticated backend routing, reservation-before-await coordinator ownership, prompt cancellation against non-cooperative backends, normalized optional evidence, and primary/subagent transaction placement. Live Jev quality and service availability require separate authorized-key validation; credentials and response bodies must never be committed or logged.
