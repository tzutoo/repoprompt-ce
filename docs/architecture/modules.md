# Module ownership and allowed edges

`Scripts/modularization/modules.json` is the checked first-party SwiftPM target catalog. Each row names a source root, its permitted **direct first-party** dependencies, and (where applicable) an owning test target. External package-product dependencies remain governed by `Package.swift` and SwiftPM. `make guardrails` compares the catalog with `swift package dump-package`, checks first-party imports against declared edges, and rejects new Swift files placed under a moved family's former app root. CI also builds with SwiftPM's explicit-target-dependency import check set to `error`.

The app target (`RepoPromptApp`) is the composition and product-flow owner, not the destination for new reusable infrastructure. App-free targets must not acquire an edge into `RepoPromptApp`; their owning tests use the module-scoped `make dev-test MODULE=<Target>Tests` path. An exact `FILTER=<SuiteName>` is resolved to that owning target when possible; regex or ambiguous filters retain the aggregate route (ambiguous duplicate suites require an explicit `MODULE`).

| Target family | Ownership | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RepoPrompt`, `RepoPromptMCP` | Thin executable entries | App or MCP core respectively |
| `RepoPromptApp` | Product flow, UI, composition | May depend on lower app-free targets |
| `RepoPromptMCPCore`, `RepoPromptDomainRuntime` | Headless CLI and domain runtime | Never depend on app |
| `RepoPromptCodeMapCore`, `RepoPromptRegexCore`, `RepoPromptWorkspaceCore`, `RepoPromptShared` | Narrow reusable cores | Never depend on app |
| `RepoPromptFoundation`, `RepoPromptInstrumentation` | Reusable substrate and diagnostic sink contracts | Never depend on app |
| `RepoPromptProcess` | Headless process and CLI mechanics (no `Bundle.main` or `UserDefaults.standard`) | Foundation and Shared only |
| `RepoPromptSecureStorage` | App-only secure storage | Never linked into MCP CLI |
| `RepoPromptC`, `CSwiftPCRE2`, `TreeSitterScannerSupport`, `Sparkle` | C/binary support | Leaf support targets |
| `<Module>Tests` | Tests of their corresponding module | Production target plus explicitly cataloged test support |

Each extraction adds its production and test rows to the catalog, records its former app path(s) under `moved_families`, and lowers the matching ratchet baseline. This PR adds `RepoPromptFoundation`, `RepoPromptInstrumentation`, `RepoPromptProcess`, and `RepoPromptSecureStorage`, and extends `RepoPromptRegexCore`; the app remains the implementation owner of instrumentation diagnostics. The placement rule checks newly added paths against the PR merge base, so already-existing app adapters are not mistaken for new module code.

The line ceiling is the recorded `app_target_swift_lines` baseline plus a **fixed 2,000-line headroom**. Move PRs lower the baseline by their moved lines; ordinary feature additions consume headroom rather than raising the ceiling. The `app_files_over_2000_lines` and `tests_testable_import_app_files` ratchets are non-increasing. Index and type-check budgets are separately build-produced CI gates.
