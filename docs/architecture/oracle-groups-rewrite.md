# Oracle groups architecture

Oracle groups run one request through an ordered roster of independent Oracle models. The feature preserves the existing single-Oracle path when the roster contains only the primary model.

This document explains the current implementation and its ownership boundaries.

## Product contract

An Oracle roster contains one primary model and up to four additional models. The order is significant, and duplicate model identifiers are valid. Every lane receives the same frozen input and request-level Chat Preset configuration.

An exposed Model Preset owns its complete ordered roster. Agent Models additions are not appended to a selected preset. Resolution captures the roster, strict lane models, request mode, and one Chat Preset configuration before cardinality chooses the established N=1 path or grouped N>1 runtime.

A grouped result keeps every lane outcome separate and in roster order. The group status is derived from lane outcomes:

- `completed` means every lane completed and the result has no warnings.
- `partial_failure` means the primary lane completed but at least one additional lane failed, was cancelled, or produced a warning.
- `failed` means the primary lane did not complete.

Cancellation is a lane outcome. Provider errors are also lane outcomes. The coordinator does not combine, rank, vote on, or choose among lane answers.

The first version has these non-goals:

- No answer synthesis or arbitration.
- No hidden adviser or retry work.
- No automatic winner selection.
- No migration aliases for unshipped experimental pair contracts.
- No durable group record for a direct N=1 request.

## Domain ownership

`RepoPromptDomainRuntime` owns the group contract and runtime behavior.

`OracleGroupContracts.swift` defines:

- `OracleGroupID`, `OracleLaneID`, `OracleTurnID`, and member identity.
- `OracleRoster` and its one-to-five model limit.
- `OracleGroupDescriptor`, `OracleGroupDocument`, and ordered turns.
- `OracleLaneResult`, `OracleGroupResult`, statuses, warnings, and MCP encoding.
- `OracleFrozenContextPack` and canonical pack references.

`OracleGroupCoordinator.swift` accepts a group descriptor, a turn, one input, and one plan per lane. It runs lanes with a structured task group. Completion order does not affect result order. `OracleLaneProgressGate` assigns per-lane sequence numbers and rejects progress after a terminal event.

The coordinator handles rosters with two to five lanes. Callers bypass it for N=1.

`OracleGroupRuntime` is the only mutating grouped-turn entry point. Both the app and `repoprompt-mcp --backend headless` call `execute` after they finish surface-specific routing. N=1 never enters the runtime.

## App execution

`OracleExecutionResolver` is the app-owned start authority for `oracle_send` and MCP-originated Context Builder responses. It resolves an explicit preset before raw-model interpretation, applies automatic preset priority when no explicit choice is present, captures the mode-specific Chat Preset once, and rejects any unusable lane before session or provider work. `OracleViewModel+Groups.swift` receives that resolved execution and chooses the runtime by roster count.

For N=1, the adapter calls the existing `tool_chatSend` implementation. It does not create a group document, acquire a group claim, or create lane projections.

For N>1, the adapter allocates identities and calls `OracleGroupRuntime.execute`. The runtime owns claim lifetime, post-claim reload, interrupted-turn recovery, durable prepare, lane coordination, cancellation settlement, and exact terminal publication. The adapter's callbacks restore `ChatSession` projections by canonical `memberID`, reject conflicting group metadata, invoke the existing per-lane provider path, and forward coordinator progress. A projection that claims a group ID cannot fall back to N=1 when the canonical document is missing.

A named single-chat continuation is never promoted into a group. App continuations use the persisted single-session model and Chat Preset identity or the durable group roster and per-lane session metadata. Editing Model Presets or Agent Models does not change existing app conversations; the runtime still compares the durable roster against the canonical reread around claim acquisition.

`ContextBuilderAgentViewModel` captures MCP generated-response authority before discovery and carries the resulting `ResolvedOracleExecution` through the physical capability adapter and server closure. The discovery agent and discovery model remain independent. After discovery, availability is rechecked against the captured lane models without selecting a replacement. UI-originated generation adapts the existing UI model roster and default Chat Preset into the same execution type without consulting MCP preset exposure gates.

For grouped follow-ups, `ContextBuilderOracleGroupState` fences callbacks by generation, group, turn, lane, and sequence. Bind is one-shot inside a generation, and the prepared callback records that fence before awaiting progress. One provider-visible message is packaged from the captured prompt configuration and frozen evidence, then shared by every lane. The plan or review preview shows primary-lane progress, while the final reply and export retain every lane result.

## Direct headless execution

`DirectHeadlessOracleRosterResolver` reads `models.planning_model` and `models.additional_oracle_models` from direct settings. A start-only model override replaces the primary model. Continuations reject model overrides.

`DirectHeadlessOracleAdapter` resolves an immutable child launch plan before provider dispatch.

- N=1 uses the existing direct conversation backend and writes no group document.
- N>1 creates or continues a durable group through `OracleGroupRuntime` after the frozen carrier bundle validates. The adapter keeps routing, invocation-plan storage, child launch planning, provider execution, and log projection.
- A continuation may use any member chat ID. The returned root chat ID is the primary member.
- A named chat ID that is not a canonical group member stays on the one-lane direct path even when additional models are configured; the direct conversation backend remains authoritative for validating that ID.
- A roster mismatch fails before provider dispatch.
- A carrier mismatch fails before claim acquisition or group history mutation.
- `resolveChildLaunchPlan` rechecks shutdown after planning returns, so a cleared plan cache cannot be reinserted. Partial carrier preparation revokes launch tokens and credential envelopes.

Group ID, lane ID, and claim ID travel together through the credential scope, launch reservation, child environment, token redemption, and child handshake. Partial Oracle launch identity is invalid.

A token-verified grouped child connection exposes only repository-read tools: code structure, file tree, file reads, file search, and Git inspection. The canonical Git surface is read-only (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `show`, and `blame`). Direct one-lane children retain their existing provider policy.

### Frozen Context Builder input

A direct grouped Context Builder request must use a persisted `context_pack_ref` in the canonical `oracle-pack:sha256:<digest>` form. Raw `instructions` remain available for N=1 only. The app-only `oracle_preset` argument is rejected before direct roster resolution, pack loading, carrier allocation, or provider validation. Direct starts and continuations use their settings-owned policy.

`MCPCommandRunner` accepts exactly one of `instructions` or `context_pack_ref`. The direct adapter verifies the pack schema, mode, content digest, and stored artifact before launching lanes. Invalid or missing packs fail with `context_pack_required` or the relevant pack validation error.

## Durability and claims

`DomainOracleConversationStore` stores one document per group. `OracleGroupDocument.currentSchemaVersion` is `2`. The document contains immutable group topology, the ordered roster, member chat IDs, a revision, and ordered turns. Schema 1 documents are normalized on read by deriving the terminal group status from their lane outcomes; their next mutation writes schema 2. Unknown future schemas remain fail-closed.

A turn is prepared before provider work starts. A terminal turn contains one structural result for every lane. The store uses:

- Filesystem mutation locks across processes.
- Revision compare-and-swap for save, rename, and delete.
- A transaction journal for crash recovery.
- A member-to-group index for continuation lookup.
- Filename UUID equals the embedded group ID; a missing index is invalid when group files exist.
- SHA-256 verification for frozen artifacts.

`OracleGroupClaimManager` serializes continuation, rename, delete, retention, and recovery work. A claim binds the group owner, invocation, run, runtime, and claim ID. `OracleGroupRuntime` acquires the caller-supplied claim ID, holds it across projection setup, lane execution, drain, and terminal publication, then releases it.

If terminal persistence fails, `OracleGroupTerminalPublisher` retries the same canonical outcome. It does not invent a replacement result. Cancellation drains lane callbacks and persists cancelled lane outcomes before the claim is released.

Duplicate-workspace cleanup must not rehome grouped Chat projections independently of their canonical group owner, which includes the workspace ID. Until both can migrate together, Chat sidecar preflight rejects owner-changing grouped history. Cleanup reports `sidecar_preflight_failed`, retains the duplicate workspace, and writes neither Agent nor Chat destination sidecars. Drive this boundary through `WorkspaceDuplicateCleanupTests.testGroupedOracleHistoryPreventsRetirementWithoutMovingEitherSidecarFamily`; unchanged source bytes and a loadable canonical group prove preservation.

## Settings and schema authority

The app and direct headless runtime use separate settings stores with the same semantic descriptors.

- `models.planning_model` stores the primary Oracle model.
- `models.additional_oracle_models` stores an ordered string array with at most four entries.

`OracleRosterSettingsDescriptor` is the shared descriptor authority. It preserves duplicates, trims identifiers at the settings boundary, and enforces the count and identifier length limits.

`GlobalSettingsStore` owns app settings. `DomainDirectSettingsStore` owns direct settings. `AppSettingsMCPService` and `DirectHeadlessGlobalBackend` adapt MCP values to their owning store. Both adapters use `DomainSettingValue` for string-array conversion and validation.

Model Presets persist their complete one-to-five-model roster in schema 2 `modelStrings`. Schema 1 `modelString` records migrate to one-element rosters after a complete validated decode. Migration-write failure preserves the original bytes, returns the validated in-memory presets with a settings warning, and does not enter corrupt-file recovery. Future schemas remain write-protected.

`GlobalSettingsFileStore` rejects the unshipped experimental Oracle schema versions. Unknown or experimental documents must not become migration authority or silently overwrite user settings.

`MCPDomainCanonicalToolDefinitions.swift` is the canonical MCP schema source. `docs/spec/mcp-domain-canonical-tool-definitions.generated.json` is a generated review copy. Regenerate the JSON with the command recorded in its provenance block. Do not edit it by hand.

## Presentation and export

`AgentOraclePill` displays one `Oracles · N` pill for a grouped result. Lane details remain available in roster order.

Context Builder tool cards show the primary preview and ordered lane summaries. The multi-Oracle follow-up hint states that lane results are independent. It does not tell the caller to combine, rank, vote on, or choose a winning lane.

`OracleLaneMarkdownFormatter` and `AgentOracleExport` write one section per lane in roster order. `MCPOracleToolService` decodes the canonical group result for export. The export does not modify lane text. Context Builder reports the captured execution's one model or ordered model names as `planning_model`, separately from the discovery `agent` and `model`.

When Model Presets are exposed, `oracle_utils op=models` lists presets in automatic-selection priority order with stable UUIDs, names, primary/additional lane labels, supported modes, effective Chat Preset mapping names, and lane-specific availability. When exposure is disabled or temporarily hidden, it reports the configured current model behavior.

## Validation

Use the coordinated developer daemon. Do not launch the app for source-only validation.

Run the smallest filter that owns each changed boundary:

```sh
make dev-test FILTER=OracleGroup
make dev-test FILTER=OracleLane
make dev-test FILTER=DirectHeadlessOracleGroup
make dev-test FILTER=DirectHeadlessRuntimeConfigurationTests
make dev-test FILTER=ContextBuilderOracle
make dev-test FILTER=OracleGroupBoundaryTests
make dev-test FILTER=AgentOraclePill
make dev-test FILTER=SettingsJSONOnly
make dev-test FILTER=DirectHeadlessCompositionTests/testCanonicalDefinitionsMatchReadableGeneratedReviewSnapshot
```

The focused tests must prove these invariants:

- N=1 uses the existing app and direct paths.
- N>1 preserves roster order despite completion order.
- The primary lane determines `failed` versus `partial_failure`.
- Cancellation drains lanes and produces structural outcomes.
- Prepared and terminal group documents obey revision checks.
- Claims serialize destructive lifecycle work across processes.
- Direct launch authorization binds group, lane, and claim identity.
- Grouped direct Context Builder requires one verified frozen pack.
- Settings preserve ordered duplicates and reject more than four additions.
- UI and exports retain separate ordered lane results.
- The generated MCP review copy matches the canonical Swift definitions.

Run `make guardrails` and `git diff --check` before handoff.
