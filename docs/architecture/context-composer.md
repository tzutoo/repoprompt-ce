# Context Composer

This contributor guide covers the Agent Mode Context Composer, including selected-context review, prompt packaging, Copy Prompt, Context Builder, and the services that support them.

## Scope and goals

Context Composer lets a user review the context selected for the current agent chat, shape the prompt handed to another model, and run Context Builder without leaving the transcript.

The inspector renders a resolved view of the current selection and sends user changes through the shared workspace selection services. Repository lookup, codemap resolution, and selection persistence stay outside the view layer; [`source-layout.md`](source-layout.md) defines the source-ownership boundary.

Inspector visibility and navigation are scoped to the current app window. Selections, prompt settings, and Context Builder state use the feature's existing stores.

## User-facing behavior

### Open and close

Context Composer opens from the selected-context pill below the message composer or from `⌘P` (configurable under Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts → Toggle Context Composer). The selected-context pill is the only visible entry point: it opens **Selections**, switches to it from another Context Composer tab, or closes Context Composer when **Selections** is already active. The shortcut toggles Context Composer, and the header close control closes it directly.

The native macOS inspector column is resizable and adapts to preserve useful space for the chat.

### Selections

The **Selections** tab presents the context selected for the current agent chat, separating full and sliced files under **Files** from codemap-only entries under **Codemaps**. Users can filter by file name, path, root, or directory and sort by name or token count. Each row identifies its workspace root and selection mode, with token, context-percentage, and line-count metrics when available. Row actions support previewing, copying, removing, changing the selection mode, clearing slices, copying paths, opening files, and revealing files in Finder. **Clear** removes all displayed selections.

### Prompt

The **Prompt** tab combines receiving-model instructions with clipboard packaging controls: the Standard, Plan · Architect, Review, and Manual copy presets; stored prompts; and File Tree, Code Map, and Git options. Changing File Tree, Code Map, or Git selects the Manual preset. Copy Prompt uses the current prompt text and selection when clicked.

### Context Builder

The **Context Builder** tab explores the workspace, curates context within the configured budget, and produces Plan, Review, or Question output. Generated output can become the prompt, be copied or previewed, or open in the Agent Mode Oracle popover.

Context Builder's **Preview**, **Open Oracle**, and **View in Chat** actions open the follow-up conversation in the Agent Mode Oracle popover. The popover presents the conversation for reading, copying, reviewing reasoning and model usage, selecting text, and navigating the transcript. It stays synchronized with the follow-up chat.

### Loading behavior

When the active chat changes, Context Composer waits for the new chat's selection before showing rows and totals. During updates to the current chat, matching rows remain visible while their data refreshes. File and codemap counts become available independently, and metrics remain hidden until their values are known.

## Layering

    UI["Context Composer"] --> STORE["AgentContextDrawerUIStore"]

    RESOLVER --> CONTEXT["WorkspaceFileContextStore"]

```

`AgentModeDetailWithSidebarView` mounts the native inspector beside the chat. `AgentContextInspectorPresenter` connects its visibility to the presentation store, and `AgentContextControlDrawerView` owns the tab shell and selected-context model lifecycle.

## Invariants and rationale

**Observation isolation.** Context Composer detail state is observed within the inspector subtree. The chat surface receives only the presentation state and the action that opens Context Composer, keeping filter, sort, navigation, loading, and row updates from invalidating the transcript.

**Context Builder Oracle presentation.** Context Builder routes each follow-up conversation by workspace, tab, and chat. `AgentOraclePill` presents the shared chat transcript with its non-mutating action policy, while the chat session remains the source of truth for live message updates.

**Native inspector layout.** SwiftUI's `.inspector` owns width, resizing, cursor behavior, and resize persistence. `AgentContextInspectorColumnSizing` derives a bounded inspector width from the available detail width so the chat remains usable in narrow layouts.

**Context-aware loading.** `AgentSelectedFilesModelCoordinator` distinguishes the requested context, the context currently displayed, and any context being loaded. Rows are mutable only when the displayed data belongs to the active context and no replacement load is underway. A chat switch therefore withholds stale rows, while an update within the same chat can keep matching rows visible and read-only until the refresh completes.

**Current-state copying.** Copy Prompt flushes pending selection edits, reads the current prompt, and captures the active selection and worktree bindings when clicked. Cached lookup data is reused only when it belongs to that same context.

**Explicit readiness.** Counts and metrics carry readiness independently. Unknown values remain pending rather than appearing as zero, and the header token estimate appears only for a complete, current selection snapshot.

## State ownership

| Concern | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Inspector visibility | `AgentContextDrawerPresentationStore` |
| Active tab, filter, and sort | `AgentContextDrawerDetailStore` |
| Open, close, and toggle behavior shared by Context Composer entry points | `AgentContextDrawerUIStore` |
| Selected files and active-tab mutations | `StoredSelection` and `WorkspaceSelectionCoordinator` |
| Instructions, copy configuration, and token counting | `PromptViewModel` |
| Context Builder execution and generated output | `ContextBuilderAgentViewModel` |
| Selected-context loading, readiness, caching, and mutation gating | `AgentSelectedFilesModelCoordinator` |

## Selected-context model

`AgentContextExportViewContext` captures the active Compose tab, agent session, prompt, selection, and worktree bindings. `AgentContextExportResolver` maps that context to display rows, metrics, previews, and clipboard content. Selection changes return through `WorkspaceSelectionCoordinator`, which updates the active tab's `StoredSelection`. Metrics distinguish known values from values that are still loading.

## Copy pipeline

Copy Prompt assembles the clipboard content from a single snapshot of the active context:

1. Capture the current prompt, selection, worktree bindings, and matching lookup data.
2. Resolve stored prompts and Git review context.
3. Resolve the codemaps needed by the selected copy configuration.
4. Collect selected file content, project structure, and Git diff content.
5. Package the configured sections and write them to the pasteboard.

## Validation

Start with the focused suite for the boundary being changed:

```bash
make dev-test FILTER=AgentContextDrawerUIStoreTests
make dev-test FILTER=AgentContextExportResolverTests
make dev-test FILTER=AgentSelectedFilesModelCoordinatorTests
make dev-test FILTER=AgentContextInspectorColumnSizingTests
```

Selection-card presentation, token accounting, Git actions, and chat-switch behavior have additional focused coverage in `AgentContextSelectedFileCardTests`, `TokenCountingViewModelTests`, `GitViewModelSelectionClearTests`, and `AgentModeChatSwitchActivationTests`. Use the contribution matrix in [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for repository-wide lint, build, and PR-ready gates. Because Context Composer is running-app Agent Mode UI, also follow the live CE MCP smoke flow there when behavior changes.
